# First-Year-C-Javascript-NUIG
My C and JavaScript assignments and code for first year Computer Science and Information Technology in Nationa University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG)

This repository contains my assignments and projects that I have worked on during Semester 2 of Computer Science and Information
Technology Year 1 in National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG).

The main languages I have done this year are C and plain JavaScript (with some jQuery as well). All of my C assignments have been
basic console programs, dealing with file input/output, data structures, pointers and user input/output. This can be particularly
seen in my Individual Project, a Countdown game.

The JavaScript assignments deal with DOM manipulation, matrix addition, dealing with images and multimedia, basic operations
and getting input from the user.

I've commented all of my programs to make them easy to understand (although I hope none of what I have written is too complicated)
and most of the code should be understandable at a glance.

Thank you for looking at my first repository.
